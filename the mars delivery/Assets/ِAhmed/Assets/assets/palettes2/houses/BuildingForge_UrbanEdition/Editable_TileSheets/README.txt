BuildingForge: Urban Edition – Editable Tilesheets
===============================================

This folder contains organized tilesheet PNGs intended for custom editing or manual building layout.

Each image is arranged to a precise 32×32 or 48×48 pixel grid. You can easily select tiles using any basic graphics software (e.g. Photoshop, Aseprite, GIMP) with the marquee/selection tool set to grid snapping.

Files Included:
---------------
• BuildingForge_BuildingKit_32x32.png        – All modular building components (windows, doors, poles, signs, etc.) on 32×32 grid
• BuildingForge_BuildingExamples_32x32.png   – Five example buildings built using 32×32 parts

• BuildingForge_BuildingKit_48x48.png        – All modular building components on 48×48 grid (for RPG Maker MZ users)
• BuildingForge_BuildingExamples_48x48.png   – Five example buildings built using 48×48 parts

Usage Notes:
------------
- These sheets are *not* formatted for direct use in RPG Maker. They are meant for visual editing, custom assembling, or reference purposes.
- You may copy and paste parts manually into your own tilesheets or projects.
- Keep grid snapping enabled to maintain perfect alignment.
